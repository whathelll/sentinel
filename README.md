#Where is what?



#To do
- have different operations e.g. post with data and header (doesn't seem to post the body yet)
- evaluate version with regular expression (a field on the server record)
- set up sample data that has VE132/133
- evaluate response content rather than just look at 200 status

- edit servers
- add servers
- add server groups

- short circuit mechanism
- an event bus

- server actions - stop/start with outputs
- view logs?
